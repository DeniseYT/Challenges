Given a string with a month and a year (separated by a space), return the number of days in that month.
Leap years are a bit tricky. A year is a leap year if and only if:
it is evenly divisible by 4
except if it is divisible by 100, in which case it isn’t
except if it is divisible by 400, in which case it is
So, for example, 1904 was a leap year. 1900 is divisible by 100, so it wasn’t. 2000 is divisible by 400, so it was.
