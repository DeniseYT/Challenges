Python programmers write variable names in snake_case, where each word is lowercased and joined by underscores. JavaScript programmers write variable names in camelCase, where the initial word is lowercase, and other words are capitalized and jammed together.

Given a variable name in snake_case, return a string with that variable name written in camelCase.

For example:
>>> snake_to_camel("hi_balloonicorn")
'hiBalloonicorn'
